# Realtime statistics screenshot verification

## Delivered
Compact Camera action beside refresh, using the existing cyan panel token, 11px icon, rounded action and focus ring. Busy state prevents duplicate clicks. Capture includes the full current enabled-card scroll area, title and source while omitting capture/refresh controls and dialogs. The same path is used for embedded/standalone panels and every Agent/environment because it captures rendered statistics, not Agent-specific logs.

A synchronous snapshot freezes inherited theme styles and canvas pixels before lazy renderer import. The inert offscreen clone is expanded and removed in finally. Ordinary output uses at least 2x density and follows high-density displays up to 3x, while retaining the 16M pixel / 16384-dimension budget; extremely large captures scale proportionally or fail explicitly instead of silently cropping. Tauri Image.new receives RGBA plus width/height; writeImage writes the native clipboard and the resource is closed in finally. No upload or image file is created by the feature.

## Checks passed
- Node: 5 tests (`statsScreenshot.test.mjs` and `terminalStatsPanel.test.mjs`), including dimensions, native payload, resource release after success/failure, permission and translation presence.
- Browser: 7 standalone renderer cases. Dark/light at top/middle/bottom each produced a complete 240x1096 image. Pixel assertions verified inherited background, Canvas chart, SVG chart and bottom card; live scroll/layout remained unchanged and post-click source changes did not contaminate the image. Oversized capture rejected and removed its temporary host.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passed. Rust check also validated the added clipboard permission.
- Normal and strict architecture checks: 962 source files, zero over-limit files / violations. `git diff --check` passed.
- GitNexus TerminalStatsPanel pre-edit impact LOW. Final detect_changes includes the earlier diagnostics work and reports aggregate critical risk; this feature adds only the panel action/boundary, export modules, translations and write-image permission.

## High-density review correction
- Root cause: the desired export ratio used the display DPR directly, so a 100%-scaled display produced the original 240x1096 browser fixture at only 1x; the renderer and clipboard preserved those insufficient source pixels exactly.
- Regression coverage now requires 2x at DPR 1 and 1.5, preserves 2x at DPR 2, follows DPR 3, and keeps oversized captures within the existing pixel/dimension budget. The standalone browser fixture also rejects any ordinary capture below 2x.
- `node --test scripts/statsScreenshot.test.mjs`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and `npm run check:architecture -- --strict` passed. The browser fixture compiled to a standalone local file, but this session did not expose browser control, so its pixel assertions were not executed here.

## Manual desktop acceptance
The repository forbids agents from starting CLI-Manager/Tauri for UI validation; none was started. Browser tests used a static local fixture, not the application. A human must verify:
1. Click Camera in the real live statistics header, then paste into Paint or a chat input and confirm an image containing the final card; at 100%-150% display scaling, verify the pasted image is 2x the panel's CSS width and text remains sharp when zoomed.
2. Repeat after scrolling and switching the app between zh-CN/en-US and light/dark panel skins.
3. Check header spacing in narrow/embedded/fullscreen panels, and ensure background-image mode still renders as expected.
4. Confirm success/failure toast behavior with the native desktop clipboard. Native SDK operations were mocked in unit tests, so actual clipboard pasting is not claimed as tested.

## Records and scope
New task approved by user in existing worktree; TEMP entries added to CHANGELOG and docs/功能清单. Component export contract updated. html-to-image 1.11.13 added as a lazy dependency after reading upstream README documentation via Context7; installed Tauri SDK declarations/source verified. Earlier diagnostics/resume edits were retained, no Git synchronization, commit, push or task archival performed. Implementation complete, awaiting manual acceptance in review.

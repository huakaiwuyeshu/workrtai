# Convergence progress — 2026-09-07

## Rust ownership and final gate

- 236 of 243 desktop Rust sources moved into domain/infrastructure/shared ownership, preserving 78 logical registry routes. Eleven compiler-owned include/path strings resolve to the original resources. `verify-rust-move.mjs` compares all 243 complete files against `8cf2a86c`, allowing only those explicit path attributes/literals.
- Rust scanner masks literals and nested comments, reads grouped/direct crate references and resolves stable registry aliases to physical layers. Eleven architecture rule tests pass; strict scan has 946 files and zero violations.
- `cargo check --locked`: pass. Desktop library: 1237 pass / 1 pre-existing ignore. SSH Agent: 97 + 3 pass. Shared crates: history-core 9, hook-schema 16, agent-capabilities-core 10 pass.
- Standalone shared libraries have no committed lockfiles. Their initial --locked invocation correctly refused to create one; history/capabilities tests then used offline standalone resolution and the existing desktop target directory. The newly generated untracked capabilities lockfile was removed; no dependency version or manifest changed.
- Node static/in-memory suite: 657 pass. CLI wrapper uses mocked cargo/tauri executables: 20 checks pass without starting the app. App-level codex-proxy e2e and desktop/remote manual interaction remain unexecuted by design.
- A local shell invocation emitted an R6016 thread-data message before cargo check; cargo itself completed successfully, and subsequent library/Agent/shared tests all passed. No application behavior workaround was added.
- Empty retired directory cleanup was rejected by execution policy; no contents were deleted. These untracked empty directories do not appear in Git or contain implementation owners.
- Final human-facing report and explicit pending desktop checklist: docs/AI架构治理验收.md.
- Staged namespace move graph check succeeded: 39 indexed changes / 0 affected flows / low aggregate risk. Full byte/registry audit supplements old-path index coverage.
- Post-commit GitNexus refresh attempted per gitnexus-cli skill, failed with Access denied for `.gitnexus/lbug`. CLI status still reports indexed commit cd9d549 versus current 8a5325df. Read-only exclusive open and file ACL read are also denied. No permissions changed, index deleted or unrelated process killed. This environment maintenance limitation is documented separately from completed code/automated acceptance.

## Frontend ownership completion

- 519 TS/TSX modules inventoried, 432 source path mappings changed, 7 redundant facades removed after all callers moved. Three owned CSS files moved byte-for-byte. No source remains in retired components/hooks/stores/lib/terminal/desktop-pet directories.
- 120 cross-domain public targets use direct cohesive api modules or existing index/state entries; no generated facade barrels or duplicate stores. Shared preferences and pure wire types keep shared code independent of features.
- `verify-frontend-move.mjs`: 511 complete modules match checkpoint `9488d0be` after reversing resolved path edits, plus the extracted RemoteHandoffAgent type and 3 unchanged stylesheets. All function bodies, module-level initialization, JSX and exports match; only the type's ownership moved.
- TypeScript passes. Static/in-memory Node suite: 654 pass, 0 fail (excludes application-launch e2e and CLI-launch integration tests). Production build: 6964 modules, 54.80s. Strict architecture: 944 source files, 0 violations.
- Baseline before migration: 652 pass / 1 failure. That failure referenced terminalCursorMovement.ts deleted in `4511f916` on 2026-07-16; obsolete test removed, existing terminal mouse behavior suite retained. Other failures were stale paths/transpilation stubs, fixed to point at actual owners without weakening behavior assertions.
- Migration preview validates explicit workspace-contained targets, destination uniqueness, complete resolution and byte-preserving edits outside import/type/asset/worker paths. Locale/worker suffixes are not assumed to be file extensions; preserve explicit TS URLs separately from extensionless imports.
- GitNexus: 2182 symbols analyzed; 77 HIGH/CRITICAL, 69 unindexed. High-risk global APIs warned before migration. See frontend-impact-review.json. Direct source import inventory supplements stale/same-name indexed lookups.
- All-scope detect_changes initially hit Git ENOBUFS because deleted owners were unstaged. After staging source/test renames, staged detect_changes succeeded (209 indexed changes / 0 flows / low aggregate risk). 2106 resolved import edges additionally compare exactly after facade removal; no new cycle or eager edge.
- Remaining: Rust physical/domain ownership convergence, Rust-aware boundary checks, final combined gate and task/session wrap-up. Frontend completion does not mark the parent goal complete.

## Earlier length cleanup

- Pinned temporary Prettier 3.6.2 expanded 7 compressed JSX modules. No package/lockfile dependency added. `verify-jsx-format.mjs` compares compiled React/JavaScript AST semantics against `6cf6222d`; all seven match, including JSX text children and concatenated className bytes.
- Two Rust long strings split with concat!: backup test SQL and live-server reload script. `verify-rust-literals.mjs` confirms literal bytes unchanged. Explicit format arguments retain macro compatibility.
- TypeScript and production build pass. Rust library: 1237 pass, 1 existing ignored. 43 combined focused Node tests pass.
- Empty architecture debt baseline; strict check passes at 950 source files before the additional navigation test (rerun at checkpoint). Full frontend/Rust ownership and boundary enforcement still outstanding, not claimed complete.
- No Tauri/UI launch, no refactor push. Existing Git branch has no upstream.
- Pre-commit GitNexus reports CRITICAL aggregate scope (235 indexed symbols / 28 flows), predominantly formatted SSH/sync/statusline/group pages. Reviewed changed owners are limited to the seven semantically identical TSX modules, editor extraction and two byte-identical Rust expressions. The index includes stale/misresolved same-name downstream flows and misses new owners; exact AST/literal audits, direct-owner tests and compilers supplement it. Warning reported before checkpoint.

# History List and Search Index Contracts

## Scenario: Cached history list and full-text search

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing history list loading, global search, history root discovery, or JSONL cache invalidation.
- Goal: list/search requests must not synchronously parse every Claude/Codex transcript.

### 2. Signatures

- Existing commands remain compatible: `history_list_sessions(...) -> Vec<HistorySessionSummary>` and `history_search(...) -> Vec<HistorySearchResult>`.
- Index commands: `history_get_index_status(...) -> HistoryIndexStatus` and `history_refresh_index(..., wait) -> HistoryIndexStatus`.
- Event: `history-index-status` with `rootsKey`, `phase`, `indexedFiles`, `totalFiles`, `generation`, `partial`, `lastCompletedAt`, and `error`.
- Derived cache: installed `.cli-manager/history-cache/history-catalog.db`; Tauri dev `.cli-manager/history-cache-dev/history-catalog.db`.

### 3. Contracts

- The catalog DB is derived and rebuildable; never store it in `cli-manager.db` or treat it as user-authored data.
- List requests query cached summaries first and schedule fingerprint-based background refresh. Catalog collection includes local/WSL Kimi Code `sessions/<workDirKey>/<sessionId>/agents/main/wire.jsonl` using the same `HistoryRoots.kimi_config_dir` / `$KIMI_CODE_HOME` / `~/.kimi-code` resolution as the disk collectors; nested `agents/agent-*` wires stay out of the catalog.
- A realtime lookup scoped to `source=grok`, an exact UUID session ID, `limit=1`, and `offset=0` may bypass a catalog miss by checking only `<grok-root>/sessions/<workspace>/<session-id>/updates.jsonl`; it must validate the UUID before joining paths and still honor the optional project path.
- A realtime lookup scoped to `source=kimi`, a valid Kimi session ID, `limit=1`, and `offset=0` may bypass a catalog miss by checking `session_index.jsonl` and `<kimi-home>/sessions/<workDirKey>/<session-id>/agents/main/wire.jsonl`. Apply matching valid index records in file order: the latest active record wins, a latest `{sessionId, deleted:true}` record clears it, and a malformed non-deletion record is ignored instead of masking the previous state. An active record must carry string `sessionDir` and `workDir`; `sessionDir` must be absolute, remain inside `<kimi-home>/sessions`, and end with the same session ID. The ID must be 1–128 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` with no `/`, `\`, NUL, or `..`; validate history/state/Hook IDs again before constructing a shell resume command. Honor the optional project path. Legacy `~/.kimi` is never scanned.
- Kimi deletion preserves the upstream append-only index protocol: append one newline-terminated tombstone with one `write_all`, prefixing a separator newline in the same buffer when the existing file has a partial tail, then remove the validated session directory. Never read/filter/replace the entire shared index. Catalog and exact lookup must honor a final tombstone even when a residual directory still exists. If directory removal fails, append the previous active record as best-effort compensation; a failed tombstone append must leave the directory untouched.
- Grok deletion removes the validated session directory under `<grok-root>/sessions/<workspace>/<session-id>` after backing up `updates.jsonl`, `summary.json`, and `signals.json` when present. The session id must be 1–128 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` with no `/`, `\`, NUL, or `..`. Paths must remain inside the Grok history home and must not be the history home itself or a direct child of it. Directory removal failure must not claim success and should restore backed-up files when possible. SSH Grok history remains unsupported. WSL UNC inventory uses `wsl.exe find -name updates.jsonl` and does not fall back to host recursion.
- Realtime forced refresh uses `history_refresh_index(..., wait=false)`. A large derived catalog rebuild must never hold the panel's single-flight polling request; later polls consume the direct Grok result or refreshed catalog.
- Opening history must schedule the same TTL-governed refresh even when the frontend reuses its in-memory list.
- Search requires at least three Unicode characters and uses FTS5 trigram literal matching; user text must be quoted/escaped before `MATCH`.
- First indexing is recent-first and partial results remain usable. A ready generation change reloads the list and current search.
- Project filtering uses indexed normalized `cwd` plus Claude encoded project keys; it must not reopen every JSONL in the request path.
- Editing/deleting/converting history marks the catalog dirty. Refresh replaces only changed files and removes missing files.
- WSL history inventory continues to use `wsl.exe` discovery rather than native recursive UNC enumeration.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Query has fewer than 3 characters | Return no global hits; frontend shows the minimum-length hint. |
| Catalog is empty but legacy JSON cache exists | Seed summary rows, return the cached list, then build message FTS in background. |
| File fingerprint is unchanged | Reuse catalog rows without parsing the transcript. |
| File changed or parser version changed | Atomically replace that file's summary/message/FTS rows. |
| File disappeared | Delete its message and summary rows. |
| Catalog refresh fails | Keep previous rows and emit `phase=error`; never delete source JSONL. |
| Catalog DB is malformed | Recreate only the derived catalog and rebuild. |
| Exact Grok UUID is absent from catalog but exists on disk | Return that session directly without scanning every transcript or falling back to the project's latest session. |
| Exact Kimi session ID is absent from catalog but exists on disk | Return that session directly without scanning every transcript or falling back to the project's latest session. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: opening history with thousands of files returns cached rows before the background scan completes.
- Good: typing a three-character code fragment queries FTS without reading transcript files.
- Base: the first install has no legacy cache, so progress and partial results appear until indexing completes.
- Bad: calling `refresh_history_index()` or `iter_session_messages_filtered()` for every keystroke.
- Bad: collecting catalog files for Claude/Codex/Grok/Pi but omitting Kimi, so the history workspace list stays empty while realtime exact lookup still works.
- Bad: storing the FTS cache in the main user database or clearing usable rows after a transient scan error.

### 6. Tests Required

- Rust: FTS schema/triggers support Chinese and ASCII trigram matches; literal quoting handles embedded quotes.
- Rust: unchanged fingerprints skip parsing; changed and deleted files update only their own rows.
- Rust: project/source filters and pagination preserve existing command behavior.
- Rust: exact Kimi session lookup finds the matching workspace session, rejects a different project path and traversal input, applies latest-wins/tombstone index records without letting malformed lines mask valid state, and rejects escaped or mismatched `sessionDir`; catalog file collection includes the main `wire.jsonl` and excludes nested subagent wires. Delete tests assert an appended tombstone rather than disappearance of historical index lines. Frontend resume tests reject Kimi IDs containing shell metacharacters.
- Frontend: stale searches cannot overwrite the newest query; one/two-character input does not invoke search.
- Run `cargo test history --lib`, `cargo check`, and `npx tsc --noEmit`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
for entry in refresh_history_index(&roots) {
    iter_session_messages_filtered(&entry.file_ref.path, &query, collect_hit)?;
}
```

#### Correct

```rust
let hits = catalog::search_sessions(&roots, &query, source, project_path, limit).await?;
catalog::ensure_refresh(app, roots, false, false).await?;
```

## Scenario: Codex thread-name title candidates

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing Codex history summary/detail/search title resolution or local/WSL/SSH history cache reuse.
- Goal: expose the Codex `session_index.jsonl` thread name as a source title candidate without changing raw transcripts or crossing source-instance boundaries.

### 2. Signatures

- Source file: `<Codex config root>/session_index.jsonl`, parsed as bounded JSONL records containing `id` and `thread_name`.
- Existing output fields remain authoritative: the matched name is applied to `HistorySessionSummary.title`, detail title, search hit title, and the SSH equivalent; no new IPC field is required.

### 3. Contracts

- Candidate precedence at the renderer is `alias > valid AI title > Codex thread_name > existing source title/first user message > session id`. A source name must never overwrite an alias or generated title.
- Windows local, WSL (through the existing distro/path command boundary), and SSH (inside the resolved remote config root) read only their own source instance. Lookup requires the matching Codex session ID within that instance.
- Parse line by line, ignore malformed/blank/mismatched records, and let the last valid non-empty record for an ID win. Enforce the 8 MiB index read bound and a bounded title length.
- Store a file fingerprint with derived cache state. A changed or newly available index invalidates Codex summary/catalog reuse and refreshes titles; direct detail/list/search paths may overlay the current resolver so stale derived rows do not hide a new name.
- Missing, inaccessible, oversized, or malformed index data is a local fallback condition and must not prevent other history sources from loading. Never write a thread name back to a transcript or Codex state file.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Valid matching record | Use its trimmed bounded `thread_name` as the source title |
| Duplicate ID | Last valid non-empty record wins |
| Bad row, blank name, or mismatched ID | Ignore it and retain the existing title fallback |
| Index missing/oversized/unreadable | Continue history loading without a thread-name override |
| Index fingerprint changes | Reparse affected Codex summaries/catalog rows on the next refresh |
| Same session ID under another source instance | Never reuse the name across local, WSL, SSH, or unrelated roots |

### 5. Tests Required

- Rust tests cover valid/duplicate/invalid records, bounds, source matching, fallback, and local/WSL/SSH cache invalidation paths.
- Run `cargo test history --lib`, `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/ssh-agent/Cargo.toml`, `cargo check`, and `cargo fmt -- --check`.

## Scenario: Compact FTS catalog schema upgrade

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing the rebuildable `history-catalog.db` FTS storage mode or reclaiming catalog fragmentation.
- Goal: prevent trigram index pages and repeated replacement freelist pages from growing far beyond the indexed message text.

### 2. Signatures

- `ensure_schema(conn: &mut SqliteConnection) -> Result<(), String>` remains the catalog schema entry point.
- `fts_trigram_query(query: &str) -> String` creates an `AND` expression of overlapping literal trigrams.
- Schema version advances from 5 to 6 after the FTS rebuild and metadata update complete.

### 3. Contracts

- Fresh catalogs create both FTS5 tables with `detail='none'` and `tokenize='trigram case_sensitive 0'`.
- Existing v5 catalogs drop/recreate both FTS tables and their three maintenance triggers, rebuild from the ordinary message tables, then run one `VACUUM`.
- The v5→v6 rebuild runs for `0 < user_version < 6`; catalogs reporting `user_version >= 6` must still inspect both FTS `sqlite_master.sql` definitions and rebuild when either table is missing `detail='none'`. Fresh creation must not perform a redundant rebuild or vacuum.
- `detail='none'` cannot evaluate the existing multi-token phrase query or provide `snippet()`. Search must bind overlapping trigrams to FTS with `AND`, then apply a case-insensitive contiguous `instr()` filter against the ordinary message content and derive a bounded prefix snippet from that content.
- Schema/version metadata is written only after all upgrade operations succeed. The catalog remains a derived cache; source history files are never modified.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Fresh catalog | Create compact FTS directly; do not rebuild/vacuum again |
| Existing v5 catalog | Preserve message rows, rebuild both FTS tables, compact pages, advance to v6 |
| `user_version >= 6` but either FTS table has the legacy detail mode | Rebuild both FTS tables and restore their triggers before serving the catalog |
| English or Chinese query of at least 3 characters | Return contiguous matches with the existing result fields |
| Query contains quotes | Escape each trigram as a bound FTS literal; never interpolate user input |
| FTS rebuild or metadata update fails | Return the error and do not report the new schema version |
| Normal incremental insert/update/delete | Triggers keep FTS synchronized; do not run full `VACUUM` per refresh |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `history` becomes `"his" AND "ist" AND "sto" AND "tor" AND "ory"`, then the ordinary table verifies the contiguous match.
- Base: a three-character Chinese query is one trigram and continues to match normally.
- Bad: use `snippet()` or bind the complete phrase directly with `detail='none'`; SQLite rejects phrase evaluation because positional detail is absent.
- Bad: run `VACUUM` after every changed transcript; large history refreshes become blocking maintenance operations.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert fresh schema triggers support Chinese and English trigram matches.
- Build a v5 FTS schema, call `ensure_schema`, and assert `detail='none'`, message preservation, both language matches, and `user_version=6`.
- Assert search merging still returns V2 and legacy message hits with bounded content snippets.
- Run `cargo test history --lib`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, and `cargo check`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
WHERE history_messages_fts MATCH ?
// bind: "history"
// SELECT snippet(history_messages_fts, ...)
```

#### Correct

```rust
WHERE history_messages_fts MATCH ?
  AND instr(lower(m.display_content), lower(?)) > 0
// bind: "his" AND "ist" AND "sto" AND "tor" AND "ory"
```

## Scenario: Bound Terminal Markdown Preview Freshness

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: a completed local Claude/Codex Hook turn asks the terminal Markdown preview for the exact bound `cliSessionId` before the history catalog has observed the newly written transcript.
- Goal: the preview may wait for one targeted catalog refresh without blocking PTY output, losing the terminal background-image rendering path, or showing another session.

### 2. Signatures

- Frontend helper: `fetchLatestProjectSessionDetail(projectPath, prev, source, cliSessionId, options?)`.
- Realtime options: `forceCatalogRefresh?: boolean`, `freshDetail?: boolean`, and `waitForCatalogRefresh?: boolean`.
- Tauri command: `history_refresh_index(..., wait: boolean) -> HistoryIndexStatus`.

### 3. Contracts

- A bound preview lookup must match `source + cliSessionId`; a project/path miss must never fall back to an unrelated recent session.
- `waitForCatalogRefresh=true` is reserved for the explicit bound Markdown preview and is passed to `history_refresh_index`; statistics polling keeps the default non-blocking `false` behavior.
- The preview records its load trigger only after receiving a non-null matching detail. A catalog miss, parse error, or transport error remains retryable when the panel is opened or refreshed.
- The preview consumes `SessionTranscriptContent` only; it must not alter xterm output, the terminal background-image wrapper, transparency, WebGL policy, or split geometry.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Exact session is already indexed | Load detail through the normal fast path. |
| Exact session is missing and preview requests freshness | Wait for one forced catalog refresh, then retry the exact lookup. |
| Refresh or detail loading fails | Show the existing preview error and leave the trigger uncommitted so a later open/refresh can retry. |
| Source/session identity mismatches | Return no detail; never display another session's answer. |
| Background image is active | Keep the existing terminal DOM/background stacking and xterm content path unchanged. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: Hook completion races catalog indexing; the preview waits for the refresh and renders the final assistant message for the same session.
- Base: the catalog already contains the session; no forced refresh is needed.
- Bad: cache a failed hidden preload trigger and make opening the visible panel permanently reuse the failure.
- Bad: use the project's latest session as a fallback when the bound `cliSessionId` is absent.

### 6. Tests Required

- Frontend source regression test: assert preview freshness passes `waitForCatalogRefresh=true`, the store forwards it as `wait`, and failed loads do not write the loaded trigger.
- Frontend background regression test: assert the existing terminal background-enabled wrapper and xterm container remain present.
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and the Markdown preview/background layout Node tests.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
loadedTriggerRef.current = trigger;
void loadLatest();
```

#### Correct

```typescript
void loadLatest(trigger);
// inside the successful matching-detail branch:
loadedTriggerRef.current = trigger;
```

## Scenario: Catalog Schema Compatibility Upgrade

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding columns, indexes, triggers, or constraints to the rebuildable `history-catalog.db` schema.
- Goal: installed catalogs must upgrade in place without requiring users to delete cache files.

### 2. Signatures

- Schema entry point: `ensure_schema(conn: &mut SqliteConnection) -> Result<(), String>`.
- V2 schema upgrade: `ensure_v2_schema(conn: &mut SqliteConnection) -> Result<(), String>`.
- Compatibility helper: `ensure_column(conn, table, column, definition) -> Result<(), String>`.
- `PRAGMA user_version` is written only after all table, column, index, and metadata updates succeed.

### 3. Contracts

- Compatibility columns must be ensured before creating any index, trigger, constraint, or query that references them.
- Fresh database creation and legacy upgrade must converge on the same final schema and indexes.
- Compatible upgrades preserve catalog rows. Destructive recreation remains limited to malformed or non-database files.
- Schema initialization is idempotent; reopening an upgraded catalog must not rewrite or reject its schema.
- Catalog opens must serialize schema initialization inside the process so compatibility `PRAGMA table_info` and `ALTER TABLE` steps cannot race across connections.
- Foreign-key support indexes for cascades and `ON DELETE SET NULL` paths must be created and upgraded idempotently; deleting or replacing one history session must not scan unrelated `history_message_parts`, `history_tool_events`, or child session relation rows for every message.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Catalog file does not exist | Create the complete current schema. |
| Older table lacks a newly required column | Add the column with its compatibility default before dependent DDL runs. |
| Older index conflicts with the replacement index | Drop the obsolete index after columns exist, then create the replacement. |
| Older schema lacks FK support indexes | Create the missing indexes in place and advance `user_version`; preserve all catalog rows. |
| Catalog already has the current `user_version` | Return through the fast path without schema writes. |
| Compatible upgrade statement fails | Return the error and do not advance `user_version`. |
| Two connections first-open the same legacy catalog | Both opens succeed; only one compatibility upgrade runs at a time. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: an existing active source row gains `scope_kind=configured` and `scope_key=desktop`, then participates in the scoped unique index.
- Base: a fresh catalog creates the new columns with the table and later creates the same index idempotently.
- Bad: place `CREATE INDEX ... scope_kind` in the initial statement list before `ensure_column(..., "scope_kind", ...)`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Build the previous-version source table and obsolete index in memory, set the old `user_version`, insert an active row, then call `ensure_schema`.
- Assert the existing row survives with compatibility defaults, the replacement index exists and enforces uniqueness, and a second `ensure_schema` call succeeds.
- Open one legacy catalog concurrently through two connections and assert both opens complete with the current schema version.
- Simulate a previous catalog schema missing FK support indexes, run `ensure_schema`, and assert the indexes exist without dropping rows.
- Force a metadata write failure and assert `user_version` remains at the previous version.
- Keep fresh-schema tests and the focused `cargo test history --lib` suite passing.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
create_scoped_index(conn).await?;
ensure_column(conn, "history_source_instances", "scope_kind", definition).await?;
```

#### Correct

```rust
ensure_column(conn, "history_source_instances", "scope_kind", definition).await?;
create_scoped_index(conn).await?;
```

## Scenario: Scoped SSH Remote History

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing SSH Agent history discovery/parsing, remote bridge history RPCs, catalog sync, or remote list/search/detail routing.
- Goal: expose project-scoped remote Claude/Codex history without copying the remote history tree or treating POSIX paths as desktop-local paths.

### 2. Signatures

- `history_remote_sync(...) -> Result<Value, String>` returns the Agent sync payload plus `applied: boolean`.
- Agent `HistoryScopeRequest.forceRefresh: boolean` is camel-case on the wire and defaults to `false` when older callers omit it.
- `catalog::apply_remote_sync(host_id, result) -> Result<bool, String>` returns `false` only when persisted generation/cursor state is newer.
- `ssh_db_record_history_source(input: SshHistorySourceInput) -> Result<(), String>` is the only write path for remote-history integration identity in `cli-manager.db`.
- Frontend `requestRemoteHistorySync(context, options) -> Promise<SshRemoteHistorySyncResult>` owns keyed in-flight request reuse and integration metadata persistence.

### 3. Contracts

- Remote `sourceInstanceId` is stable for `(remoteMachineId, sshUser, source, canonicalConfigRootHash)` and does not include `hostId`, project ID, client ID, or replaceable Agent installation ID.
- The Agent owns one rebuildable index per `(source, configRootHash)`. Writers use an Agent-side cross-process lock whose directory, permissions, and owner record are acquired transactionally; readers reuse the published generation.
- A non-forced sync with a compatible, complete index that covers every requested project path returns the requested page before acquiring the writer lock. It must not walk history directories or rewrite `index.json`.
- Missing/incompatible/partial indexes, project-scope expansion, and `forceRefresh=true` enter incremental discovery. Discovery orders files by descending modification time; a refresh with no entry, scope, tombstone, or completeness-state change preserves the published generation and index file modification time.
- JSONL indexing is append-aware and handles truncate, same-size rewrite, rotation, partial tails, tombstones, and project-scope expansion. A record larger than the 8 MiB read window is skipped with bounded cursor progress until its newline.
- Agent cursors are `generation:offset`. A generation mismatch resets pagination to offset zero; desktop fetches 21 summaries to display 20 and requests the next Agent page only from load-more.
- Desktop callers with identical host/source/root/project/cursor/limit/force-refresh inputs share one in-flight sync request, including the local integration metadata write. `consumerId` is not part of the key; the shared RPC uses a dedicated ephemeral bridge consumer released only after the request settles, so closing the first window cannot terminate another caller's shared request. Different sources, cursor pages, and refresh modes remain independent.
- A non-empty Desktop cached page renders before one background forced refresh. A known source identity with no cached rows waits for a non-forced Agent page, allowing a compatible Agent index to serve the first page without a scan. Load-more is non-forced; manual refresh is forced.
- Catalog apply obtains SQLite's short writer lease inside the transaction, then compares the persisted source generation and cursor offset. Lower generations and lower offsets in the same generation are ignored and reported as not applied; they must not replace session rows, source state, cursor, or frontend context.
- Catalog input validation, numeric bounds, and JSON serialization complete before `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. Main-database integration persistence uses WAL, a 15-second busy timeout, one connection, and one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction; the WebView must not write `ssh_agent_tool_integrations` directly.
- Remote catalog coordination must not reuse the full local refresh mutex or add a process-wide SSH synchronization mutex. WAL reads remain concurrent; SQLite serializes only the actual write transaction.
- The existing `history-catalog.db` stores remote summaries, usage facts, freshness, cursor, and identity. Summary materialization must remove persisted messages, tool events, file changes, and corresponding FTS rows.
- Full remote detail is online-only and lives in a bounded in-memory LRU. Offline behavior guarantees cached list/summary/usage only, with explicit stale/disconnected state.
- Protocol minor 3 advertises `historyDetailChunks`: payload chunks are at most 256 KiB inside the existing 1 MiB frame, aggregate detail is at most 64 MiB, and desktop validates request ID, order, total, size, and one end-to-end deadline.
- Remote history is read-only. Remote refs and paths never enter local/WSL file, Git, provider, edit, delete, snapshot, or resume APIs.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Cursor is not `generation:offset` or its generation differs from the result | `history_remote_cursor_invalid`; no catalog write |
| Incoming generation is lower than persisted generation | return `applied=false`; preserve catalog and frontend context |
| Incoming generation is equal and cursor offset is lower | return `applied=false`; preserve catalog and frontend context |
| Incoming generation is newer or same-generation offset advances | apply the complete summary transaction and return `applied=true` |
| Complete compatible index, covered scope, `forceRefresh=false` | return the cached page without writer lock, directory discovery, generation change, or index write |
| Partial index, expanded scope, or `forceRefresh=true` | run incremental discovery; tombstones only after complete discovery |
| Two callers use identical result-affecting request inputs | share one remote RPC and one integration metadata write even when `consumerId` differs |
| Catalog writer remains locked after its bounded wait | `history_catalog_busy`; preserve cached rows |
| Main integration metadata remains locked after its bounded wait | `ssh_agent_history_metadata_busy`; preserve the committed catalog result and existing integration row |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a stats poll and history refresh request the same first page concurrently and share one Promise.
- Good: opening a project with cached summaries renders immediately, then a forced refresh finds no changes and leaves `index.json` untouched.
- Good: page offset 20 commits before an older offset 10 response; offset 10 is ignored without blocking readers or another source.
- Base: equal generation and equal cursor replay is idempotent and may reapply safely.
- Base: Desktop cache is absent but the Agent has a complete index; the awaited non-forced first page returns without scanning.
- Bad: guard all remote sources with `CATALOG_REFRESH_LOCK` or let an old response update `sync_cursor_json` after a new response.
- Bad: key shared requests by `consumerId`, use that window's bridge consumer for the shared RPC, or write integration metadata through pooled frontend SQL calls.

### 6. Tests Required

- Agent: append/partial/truncate/rewrite, project scope, tombstones, stable identity, lock cleanup/recovery, oversized-record progress, cursor reset, complete-index reuse, unchanged no-write, recent-first discovery, and full history suite.
- Desktop: strict remote identity/continuation validation, numeric overflow before transaction, summary-only cleanup, pagination, stale generation/cursor rejection, distinct busy error mapping, metadata idempotency/rollback, detail chunk validation/deadline, LRU eviction, bridge consumer lifetime, and catalog tests.
- Frontend: TypeScript check plus manual rapid project/filter/window switching to confirm shared refresh survives the first consumer closing and stale list/search/detail requests cannot replace the current SSH context.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
sync_cursor_json = excluded.sync_cursor_json;
generation = excluded.generation;
```

#### Correct

Obtain SQLite's writer lease, compare persisted generation/cursor inside that transaction, and return `applied=false` before any source/session mutation when the response is stale.

## Scenario: Additive History Conversion and Explicit Deletion While Target CLI Runs

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing Claude/Codex history conversion, explicit history deletion, target bundle writers, shared JSONL indexes, or runtime mutation guards.
- Goal: additive conversion and user-confirmed deletion must not be blocked merely because another same-source CLI process exists; backup restoration remains exclusive.

### 2. Signatures

- Tauri command remains `history_convert_session(file_path, claude_config_dir, codex_config_dir, source, project_key, target_source) -> Result<HistoryConversionResult, String>`; the result includes both the target summary and the target detail parsed directly from the newly written file.
- Process guard remains `is_target_tool_running(source: &str) -> bool` for backup restore and restore-plan callers.
- Delete entry remains `history_delete_session(...)`; its internal `delete_session_tree_with_backup_root(...)` does not use the source-wide process guard.
- Shared JSONL helper remains `append_jsonl_line(path: &Path, line: &Value) -> Result<(), String>`.

### 3. Contracts

- Conversion is additive: every attempt creates a new target-native UUID and an exclusive rollout/transcript path; it never edits or replaces an active session.
- Conversion success is self-contained: before returning, the backend parses the new target transcript and verifies that detail source, session id, and file path match the returned summary. The frontend must not depend on an immediate catalog refresh to display the result.
- For a Claude target, the returned summary/detail `project_key` comes from the canonicalized target file's parent directory after the write. Do not return the lowercased cwd-derived key: on case-insensitive Windows filesystems an existing mixed-case Claude project directory may be reused, and later inventory reports that on-disk name.
- A running target CLI alone must not return `history_target_tool_running` from `history_convert_session`.
- Codex `history.jsonl` and `session_index.jsonl` records are serialized with their trailing newline and written through one append `write_all` call.
- Codex `state_5.sqlite` registration uses SQLite locking and the bounded 15-second busy timeout. A real busy timeout, schema error, or I/O error is returned; it is never converted to success.
- Explicit delete does not call `is_target_tool_running`: the process scan identifies only a CLI source, not the selected session, so it cannot prove that the selected file is active. Delete still creates backups, rolls back failures, and respects the source manual-recovery lock.
- Backup restore and restore-plan paths continue to call `is_target_tool_running`; they may overwrite an existing artifact and remain exclusive.
- `history_source_manual_recovery_required` still blocks conversion when the target source has an unresolved recovery lock.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Target CLI is running and conversion writes a new session | Continue conversion; do not return `history_target_tool_running` |
| Target SQLite writer remains busy past 15 seconds | Return `codex_state_register_failed` or the underlying database-open error |
| Target source has a manual recovery lock | Return `history_source_manual_recovery_required`; write nothing |
| New target transcript cannot be parsed back with matching identity | Return `history_conversion_detail_mismatch`; do not report conversion success |
| Claude target file cannot be canonicalized or has no project parent | Return `history_conversion_target_file_unavailable` or `history_conversion_target_project_unavailable`; do not report conversion success |
| Windows reuses an existing Claude project directory whose case differs from the cwd-derived key | Return the directory's actual on-disk name in summary/detail so `validate_session_file_ref` can reopen it |
| User confirms deletion while any same-source CLI is running | Continue the validated backup-and-delete transaction; do not return `history_target_tool_running` |
| Backup restore or restore-plan runs while the source CLI is active | Return `history_target_tool_running` |
| Source or target is unsupported, identical, or a subagent root | Preserve the existing stable validation error; write nothing |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: Claude converts to a fresh Codex rollout while other Codex sessions remain active; both shared index lines parse and the SQLite thread row registers.
- Good: Codex converts to Claude under an existing `F--ws-Labway-Fee-Control` directory; the result returns that exact project key and ordinary detail reopening succeeds.
- Good: the user deletes selected old Codex sessions while an unrelated Codex terminal is open; every selected file still goes through backup and rollback handling.
- Base: no target CLI is running; conversion behavior and result payload are unchanged.
- Bad: return the lowercased cwd encoding after Windows has reused a mixed-case directory; inventory then rejects the same file with `session_file_not_indexed`.
- Bad: apply the source-wide process guard to explicit deletion; one unrelated Codex process blocks deleting every Codex history file.
- Bad: remove the guard from backup restore and overwrite an artifact while the source CLI is active.
- Bad: keep the process guard at the conversion entry and reject every conversion from a machine currently using Codex.

### 6. Tests Required

- Rust: Claude -> Codex and Codex -> Claude writer/parser round trips preserve the new session id and messages; returned summary and detail identities match.
- Rust: Codex -> Claude with an existing mixed-case Windows project directory returns the inventory project key, passes `validate_session_file_ref`, and rebuilds detail through the ordinary reopen path.
- Rust: concurrent `append_jsonl_line` calls produce the expected record count and every line parses as JSON.
- Rust/source audit: conversion and explicit delete have no target-process guard; backup restore and restore-plan retain it.
- Frontend/static regression: deleting sessions while a same-source process exists is not rejected at the backend delete boundary.
- Run `cargo fmt -- --check`, focused conversion/append tests, `cargo test history --lib`, and `cargo check`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
if is_target_tool_running(&target_source) {
    return Err("history_target_tool_running".to_string());
}
convert_history_session(&detail, &target_source, &roots)?;
```

#### Correct

```rust
// Conversion owns a fresh target id/path; explicit deletion owns a backup transaction.
let result = convert_history_session(&detail, &target_source, &roots)?;
let deleted = delete_session_tree_with_backup_root(&file_ref, &backups_dir)?;

// Backup restore still refuses to overwrite while the source CLI is active.
let plan = build_file_restore_plan(&file_ref.path, &backups_dir, Some(&file_ref.source));
```

## Scenario: OpenCode SQLite history deletion

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: extending `history_delete_session(...)` to an OpenCode session, or changing OpenCode locator validation, writable SQLite access, or post-delete catalog invalidation.
- Goal: delete exactly one selected OpenCode session without treating its database locator as a removable file or allowing a partial dependent-row deletion.

### 2. Signatures

- Tauri command remains `history_delete_session(file_path, claude_config_dir, codex_config_dir, grok_session_root, source, project_key) -> Result<(), String>`.
- OpenCode internal mutation path remains `delete_opencode_session_from_locator(file_path)` followed by `delete_opencode_session_from_database(db_path, session_id)`.
- The OpenCode locator format is `<default-opencode-db>#session=<session-id>`.

### 3. Contracts

- `source="opencode"` accepts only the configured default OpenCode database path and a session ID matching `ses_` plus one or more ASCII alphanumeric characters. The locator is an address, never a file targeted for deletion.
- Preserve `ensure_source_mutation_unlocked("opencode")`: it blocks unresolved manual-recovery locks, but explicit deletion does not use a source-wide running-process check.
- Open the existing database for write with `create_if_missing(false)`, validate the `session`, `message`, and `part` tables, then use bound parameters in one transaction.
- Delete rows in dependency order: `part.session_id`, `message.session_id`, then `session.id`. Exactly one target `session` row must be affected; otherwise roll back and return `session_file_not_indexed`.
- Commit before calling `invalidate_history_caches()`. A failed validation, query, rollback, or commit must leave cache invalidation and the selected session's persisted rows untouched.
- Claude/Codex retain their file-tree backup/delete behavior; do not route OpenCode through `validate_session_file_ref`, `delete_session_tree`, or file backup snapshots.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Locator lacks `#session=` or has an invalid/non-`ses_` ID | `invalid_session_file`; no database open |
| Locator database differs from the default OpenCode database | `session_file_outside_history_scope`; no database open |
| Manual-recovery lock exists for OpenCode | `history_source_manual_recovery_required`; no write |
| Database is missing | `opencode_database_not_found`; no file creation |
| Required table is absent | `opencode_schema_unsupported`; no write |
| Target session does not exist | Roll back dependent deletes and return `session_file_not_indexed` |
| SQLite remains busy or a delete/commit fails | Return the database error; transaction is not committed |
| Valid target and schema | Commit target-only deletion, then invalidate history caches |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: deleting `ses_delete` removes only its parts, messages, and session row while `ses_keep` remains readable.
- Good: a stale locator for a missing session has orphan-like dependent test rows; the target-row check rolls back and preserves those rows.
- Base: Claude/Codex deletion continues through the existing backup-and-file-tree path.
- Bad: pass the OpenCode locator to `delete_session_tree`; it targets the shared database file and would delete every OpenCode session.
- Bad: commit child deletes before verifying the selected session row; malformed/stale locators could leave partial data loss.

### 6. Tests Required

- Rust: valid and malformed OpenCode locators accept only `ses_` plus ASCII alphanumeric IDs.
- Rust: a temporary SQLite fixture proves target `part → message → session` deletion, second-session preservation, and rollback when the session row is missing.
- Rust: run `cargo test history --lib`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, and `cargo check`.
- Frontend: run `npx tsc --noEmit` and OpenCode history/remote-handoff command regression tests; deletion uses the existing IPC signature.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
let file_ref = validate_session_file_ref(&file_path, "opencode", &project_key, &roots)?;
delete_session_tree(&file_ref)?;
```

#### Correct

```rust
let (db_path, session_id) = parse_opencode_session_locator(file_path)
    .ok_or_else(|| "invalid_session_file".to_string())?;
delete_opencode_session_from_database(&db_path, &session_id).await?;
invalidate_history_caches(); // only after commit
```

## Scenario: Local generated history titles

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing the optional smart title provider command, generated-title persistence, title request protocols, or history deletion/recovery.
- Goal: keep model-derived titles in the user metadata database with a strict provider-secret boundary; the history catalog and third-party transcripts remain untouched.

### 2. Signatures

- SQLite table: `history_generated_titles(session_key PRIMARY KEY, source identity, generated_title, generation_state, generation_revision, trigger_kind, source fingerprint, provider composite identity, failure_code, suppression state, timestamps)`.
- Tauri commands: `history_title_list_providers`, `history_title_generate`, `history_title_clear`, and `history_title_cancel`.
- Generate requests contain session/source identity, trigger, expected full candidate fingerprint, bounded candidate input, bounded-input fingerprint, and non-secret provider/model identifiers. They never contain API keys, OAuth tokens, base URLs, or raw provider documents.

### 3. Contracts

- Migration v30 is additive and authoritative. Frontend `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is only a compatibility repair; catalog rebuild/reset does not touch this table.
- Provider resolution is Rust-only through the Native Provider repository/runtime and the existing network client policy. Readiness returns redacted cards and stable reason codes only.
- Supported request protocols are Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses. Requests are non-streaming, text-only, have no tools/reasoning, bounded input/output/body/timeout, and do not log prompt, raw output, key, or endpoint secrets.
- Auxiliary text requests share one backend protocol helper with command suggestions. For OpenAI Responses compatibility gateways, `input` is a plain string (not a nested `input_text` message array); endpoint joining must not duplicate `/v1` or a complete endpoint.
- HTTP/request failures keep stable backend categories (timeout, rate limit, HTTP status, response-format/empty output) so the frontend can localize safe diagnostics without exposing response bodies or provider configuration.
- Reservation increments a monotonic revision and writes `pending`. Commit requires the same revision, source identity/fingerprint, pending state, current provider selection, and (for automatic work) an empty alias and enabled setting. Zero affected rows is stale/cancelled and never overwrites a newer result.
- Manual reservation may run for old sessions and with an alias; alias only affects display. Manual generation clears matching automatic suppression. Clear invalidates pending work, removes generated text, and suppresses the current fingerprint until explicit manual generation.
- Pending rows are normalized to `failed/interrupted` during frontend history metadata initialization and are never auto-dispatched after restart. Cancelled automatic work is retained as a failed attempt, preventing a background retry for the same fingerprint.
- Deleting a local session removes its generated-title row; provider deletion/disable does not remove already successful local titles. SSH may use these commands only after the desktop has loaded an online trusted detail; the command writes local metadata and never writes remotely.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Missing/disabled/keyless/invalid/unsupported provider | Return a stable redacted failure code and persist failure state; never expose credentials |
| 429, timeout, non-2xx, oversized/invalid response, tool call, abnormal finish, or empty title | Persist a safe failure code and retain any previous generated title |
| Alias added, clear, delete, provider switch, or switch-off while request is in flight | Revision/CAS or commit guard rejects the late result |
| Candidate exceeds 4096 UTF-8 bytes | Hash the normalized complete text, send only a Unicode-safe bounded prefix, and validate the bounded-input fingerprint |
| Catalog rebuild or WebDAV sync | Generated-title rows remain local and unchanged |

### 5. Tests Required

- Migration registry uniqueness/order and table/index presence.
- Sanitizer/protocol tests for controls, bidi/invisible characters, CJK/emoji, tools, abnormal finish, malformed/empty response, and bounded output.
- Targeted Rust tests plus `cargo check`; verify no secret/prompt/raw response reaches frontend state or logs.

# Agent Capability Diagnostics Contracts

## Scenario: Session-bound MCP and Skill diagnostics

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing the realtime Agent capability card, one of the five Agent adapters, MCP/Skill discovery, OpenCode session bridging, WSL routing, or SSH Agent diagnostic RPCs.
- Applies to Claude, Codex, Pi, Grok Build, and OpenCode in local, WSL, and SSH Agent environments.
- The capability snapshot is derived state. It is cached only in frontend memory and must never be written to SQLite or the settings store.

### 2. Signatures

```text
agent_capabilities_inspect({ request: AgentCapabilityCommandRequest })
  -> AgentCapabilitySnapshot
agent_capabilities_probe({ request: AgentCapabilityCommandRequest })
  -> AgentCapabilitySnapshot

opencode_hook_status() -> OpenCodeHookStatus
opencode_hook_install() -> OpenCodeHookStatus
opencode_hook_uninstall() -> OpenCodeHookStatus

SSH request kinds:
  agentCapabilitiesInspect | agentCapabilitiesProbe
SSH required capability:
  agentCapabilitiesV1
```

`AgentCapabilityCommandRequest` flattens the shared request and adds optional `wslDistroName`, `sshConsumerId`, and structured `sshLaunch`. The shared request fields are `terminalSessionId`, `cliSessionId`, `agent`, `environment`, `cwd`, optional `configRoot`, `launchArgs`, optional `baselineConfigFingerprint`, and bounded `runtimeEvidence`.

### 3. Contracts

- A request is valid only for an explicit non-empty terminal ID and the exact Hook-bound `cliSessionId`. The frontend must not substitute the latest project history session.
- Activation and health are independent: MCP activation is `active | disabled`; active health is `healthy | error | checking | unknown`. Static configuration alone yields `unknown`.
- Runtime evidence comes only from the exact bound history detail. Agent-native probe output may refine health, but the backend owns the executable and fixed arguments. Never execute a command, URL, header, environment map, or argument sourced from an MCP configuration document.
- Codex `mcp list --json` exposes OAuth state as snake_case `auth_status`; parse both `auth_status` and compatibility `authStatus`. `authenticated` may refine health to healthy and `unauthenticated` to error. `unsupported` means OAuth is not applicable and remains unknown unless exact-session runtime evidence establishes health.
- When probe output is valid structured JSON, match records by their exact normalized `name` / `id` and do not run the plaintext line fallback over the serialized JSON. Plaintext substring matching is reserved for non-JSON Agent output because names such as `authenticated` and `unauthenticated` can otherwise overwrite each other.
- Skill state is `available | disabled | denied | shadowed | invalid`. Discovery includes bounded user/project compatibility roots and installed plugin cache roots; scans do not follow directory symlinks and retain only display-safe relative labels.
- Config contents are reduced to a SHA-256 fingerprint plus normalized MCP metadata. Responses never contain commands, URLs, headers, tokens, environment values, config bodies, or raw probe stderr.
- TOML configuration input is a complete document, not an individual TOML value. With `toml 0.9`, parse it through `toml::from_str::<toml::Value>()` (or `str::parse::<toml::Table>()` and wrap the table); `str::parse::<toml::Value>()` uses `ValueDeserializer` and falsely rejects ordinary top-level assignments and leading comments.
- Local inspection uses canonical local directories. WSL inspection uses fixed `wsl.exe --exec` reads and never opens the WSL UNC path directly. SSH inspection uses only the negotiated SSH Agent RPC and never falls back to local paths.
- Frontend cache and request-generation keys include terminal, CLI session, Agent, environment identity, cwd, and config-root identity. Scope changes discard stale responses. Deep check marks active MCPs `checking` while the bounded probe is in flight.
- The summary card reuses the shared CLI brand icon and terminal-panel theme tokens. MCP and Skills summaries are separate keyboard-focusable triggers that set the controlled detail tab before opening the modal. Detail rows keep metadata in a `min-width: 0` flexible column and the status badge non-shrinking so long descriptions or paths cannot push state information outside the viewport.
- OpenCode local binding is a marker-owned global plugin. Install may create or replace only the marker-owned `cli-manager-hook.js`; an unowned same-name file is `conflict`. The plugin reports `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `StopFailure`, and missing callback environment is a silent no-op.
- SSH Agent protocol `1.11` advertises `agentCapabilitiesV1`. Missing capability produces an `upgradeRequired` snapshot; it does not downgrade to local inspection.
- Pi has no universal built-in MCP status contract. When Pi MCP Adapter configuration is present, discover its JSON sources in low-to-high precedence: `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`, `~/.agents/mcp.json`, `~/.agents/mcp/mcp.json`, `<Pi agent dir>/mcp.json`, project `.mcp.json`, then project `.pi/mcp.json`. Later sources override earlier entries with the same server name.
- For Pi MCP Adapter JSON, `disabled: true` means disabled; an entry without it is active. Static active entries remain `unknown` health and must not launch an MCP server. When none of those sources and no exact-session evidence are available, emit `pi_mcp_extension_observability_unknown` instead of claiming zero healthy servers.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|
| Empty/control-character terminal or CLI session ID | Stable `agent_capability_*_invalid`; no scan or process launch. |
| Local cwd/config root is not an existing canonical directory | Stable `agent_capability_*_unavailable`. |
| WSL distro is missing/mismatched or cwd is not a valid Linux/UNC path | Stable `agent_capability_wsl_*` error. |
| SSH launch/consumer context is absent | `agent_capability_ssh_context_required`. |
| SSH Agent lacks `agentCapabilitiesV1` | Snapshot `bridgeStatus=upgradeRequired`; no local fallback. |
| Config is unreadable, oversized, or malformed | Safe diagnostic code; no config content in the response. |
| A valid TOML document starts with a top-level key or comment | Parse the complete document with no `config_parse_error`; retain discovered MCP metadata. |
| A native MCP probe or WSL discovery command produces excessive output | Retain only the bounded prefix, drain the process pipe, and return `agent_probe_output_too_large` for probe output instead of parsing partial data. |
| Skill manifest is unreadable/oversized/malformed | Keep the candidate as `invalid` with a stable code. |
| Probe executable is missing, exits unsuccessfully, or times out | Keep the static snapshot and add `agent_probe_*`; do not launch MCP servers. |
| Codex JSON reports `auth_status=unsupported` for an enabled stdio server | Keep activation active and health unknown unless exact-session evidence establishes healthy/error. |
| Pi MCP Adapter JSON entry has `disabled: true` | Keep it in details as disabled and exclude it from active totals. |
| Pi MCP Adapter has at least one readable configured server | Report configured active/unknown or disabled state; do not emit `pi_mcp_extension_observability_unknown`. |
| OpenCode plugin path is occupied by unowned content | `opencode_hook_conflict`; preserve the file byte-for-byte. |
| Response arrives after the terminal/session scope changed | Frontend generation check discards it. |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: the active Codex session has one exact-session successful `mcp:docs` event; the card shows that configured server active and healthy while another static server remains unknown.
- Good: WSL and SSH scans execute in their own environments and return only relative source labels.
- Good: user and project Codex `config.toml` documents containing top-level keys, comments, and `[mcp_servers.*]` tables parse without diagnostics.
- Good: Codex JSON marks authenticated and unauthenticated records healthy/error by exact server name while an OAuth-unsupported stdio record remains active/unknown.
- Good: Pi MCP Adapter discovers a user `mcp.json` server and a project `.pi/mcp.json` override; the active result is shown with `unknown` health without starting either server.
- Base: a configured server has no runtime evidence and no native status; it remains active/unknown.
- Base: a disabled server remains visible in details but is excluded from active and health totals.
- Base: Pi has no readable MCP Adapter source or exact-session evidence; the card keeps the observability diagnostic instead of inventing an empty MCP list.
- Bad: mark every parsed MCP entry healthy, inspect `~/.codex` on the desktop for an SSH terminal, or bind the card to the newest project session.
- Bad: apply generic `enabled` parsing to Pi Adapter JSON and ignore its `disabled: true` flag.

### 6. Tests Required

- Shared Rust crate: static config stays unknown, disabled/shadowed entries are preserved, exact runtime failures affect only the matching server, JSONC is parsed safely, complete TOML documents parse without false diagnostics, malformed TOML still emits `config_parse_error`, and plugin Skills are bounded and discovered.
- Shared Rust crate: Codex snake_case `auth_status` is parsed, exact JSON record matching prevents overlapping server names from overriding each other, and `unsupported` remains unknown.
- Shared Rust crate: Pi MCP Adapter sources follow the documented user/project precedence; `disabled: true` is disabled, configured active entries remain unknown, and a configured entry suppresses `pi_mcp_extension_observability_unknown` without exposing command data.
- Desktop Rust: boundary validation, OpenCode marker ownership/source admission, fixed probe timeout paths, and SSH upgrade mapping.
- SSH Agent: request environment validation, `agentCapabilitiesV1` advertisement, protocol minor identity, and full Agent tests.
- Frontend Node/TypeScript: five-Agent resolution, WSL distro resolution, MCP evidence extraction, exact OpenCode hook source binding, stable error redaction, additive settings migration, and `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Manual: switch zh-CN/en-US, verify keyboard modal/tabs/filters, local and WSL sessions, SSH upgrade state, rapid split/Tab changes, and 24-hour timestamps.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```ts
const sessionId = latestProjectSession.session_id;
```

```rust
Command::new(configured_mcp.command).args(configured_mcp.args).spawn()?;
```

```rust
let root = document.content.parse::<toml::Value>()?; // Parses one TOML value in toml 0.9.
```

```rust
let enabled = value.get("enabled").and_then(JsonValue::as_bool).unwrap_or(true);
```

#### Correct

```ts
const sessionId = terminalSession.cliSessionId;
if (!sessionId) return actionableUnboundState;
```

```rust
let args = probe_args(validated_agent); // fixed backend-owned read-only command
```

```rust
let root = toml::from_str::<toml::Value>(&document.content)?; // Parses the full document.
```

```rust
let enabled = if agent == AgentKind::Pi {
    !value.get("disabled").and_then(JsonValue::as_bool).unwrap_or(false)
} else {
    value.get("enabled").and_then(JsonValue::as_bool).unwrap_or(true)
};
```

```rust
// Wrong: serialized JSON lines can match multiple overlapping server names.
for line in output.lines() {
    update_every_server_whose_name_is_a_substring(line);
}

// Correct: valid JSON uses exact record names; line fallback is plaintext-only.
if let Ok(json) = serde_json::from_str::<JsonValue>(output) {
    update_exact_probe_records(&json);
} else {
    update_plaintext_probe_lines(output);
}
```

Exact binding prevents cross-pane leakage; fixed probes prevent configuration from becoming an arbitrary command-execution surface; document parsing prevents valid user/project configuration from producing false diagnostics.


## Runtime evidence precedence (TEMP, 2026-09-07)

Evidence must match the bound CLI session ID and Agent. Only completed/succeeded or failed native results establish health; missing, started, pending, cancelled, denied and inferred call-site records do not. Prefer the newest timestamp per server. A probe with no health observation (including unsupported auth status) must not overwrite existing session health with unknown. Static configuration alone remains unknown with an explanation in both interface languages. These rules are shared by Claude, Codex, Pi, Grok and OpenCode across local/WSL/SSH diagnostics.

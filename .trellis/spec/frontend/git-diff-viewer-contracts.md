# Git Diff Viewer Contracts

## Data Source Boundary

- Shared Diff rendering consumes a discriminated `snapshot | live` data source.
- A snapshot contains text only and cannot expose mutation actions at the type level.
- A live source owns its loader and may inject explicit mutation capabilities.
- Viewer components and controllers must not invoke Tauri commands, inspect SSH state, or read the global Git Store directly.
- Local, WSL, macOS/Linux desktop, and SSH differences stay behind the caller-provided transport capability.

## Target Identity

- Every load is bound to a stable target identity plus file path, file name, and status.
- When target identity changes, the controller clears the previous selection and ignores completion from the old request.
- Consumers must not reuse a live source for a different repository context without changing target identity.

## Component Responsibilities

- `DiffViewerModal.tsx`: compatibility adapter, portal, overlay, and keyboard lifecycle only.
- `diff/useGitDiffController.ts`: load state, metadata, selection, and mutation orchestration.
- `diff/GitDiffViewer.tsx`: composition only.
- `diff/GitDiffContent.tsx`: loading/error/empty/parsed/fallback rendering.
- `diff/useGitDiffParser.ts` and `diff/gitDiffParser.worker.ts`: sync/Worker parse policy, generation cancellation, and fallback state.
- `diff/GitDiffHunkList.tsx`: Hunk virtualization, measurement, scroll, and cross-Hunk focus restoration.
- `diff/GitDiffHunkBlock.tsx`: one mounted Hunk, threshold-gated tokenization, gutter events, and Hunk revert command.
- `diff/GitDiffHeader.tsx`: file-level commands and close action.
- `diff/GitDiffSelectionBar.tsx`: partial-revert status and selected-line commands.
- `diff/types.ts`: target, data-source, mutation, parse, and controller contracts.

New navigation, display options, pinned-editor hosting, accessibility, and performance work must extend these boundaries instead of rebuilding a second Diff viewer.

## Compatibility

- Git changes use a live source with explicit load and mutation actions.
- File editor Diff uses an explicit project-bound live source.
- History and terminal-stat Diff use snapshots and remain read-only.
- Unsupported text parsing falls back to the existing read-only Monaco renderer; supported file types remain unchanged.

## Review Navigation

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- `GitDiffReviewDialog` is used only for the live Git changes review flow.
- Snapshot consumers and the file editor compatibility facade do not receive file-list navigation.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
buildGitDiffReviewTargets({
  tree,
  untrackedTree,
  statusFilter,
  repositoryPath,
  repositoryRelativePath,
}): GitDiffReviewTarget[];

type GitDiffViewMode = "split" | "unified";
```

### 3. Contracts

- The review dialog owns the filtered target list and active target identity; the controller owns the active Hunk within one target.
- The review dialog must derive its initial active target synchronously from `initialFilePath` during render and repeat that binding before paint when the dialog opens or the target tree changes; an empty active ID must never reconcile to the first file before this binding.
- Target identity is repository context plus repository-relative file path. Status and line counts must not participate in identity, so refresh can retain the same target.
- Target order is the rendered tracked tree followed by the rendered untracked tree. `M` and `D` filters exclude the untracked tree, matching `GitChangesPanel`.
- `F7` and `Shift+F7` are handled by the focusable review viewer only. They must not install a global listener or affect terminals and other windows.
- Moving past a file boundary selects the adjacent target and initializes its first or last Hunk. Navigation never wraps.
- Source opening is an injected capability. The review layer passes the project-relative source path plus the active Hunk `newStart`; it never invokes Tauri or branches on local, WSL, macOS/Linux, or SSH state.
- `settingsStore.gitDiffViewMode` defaults to `split`, accepts only `split | unified`, and belongs to the `preferences` sync domain.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Persisted mode outside `split | unified` -> migrate to `split`.
- Active target removed on refresh -> retain its previous index and select the adjacent target.
- No review targets remain -> close the review dialog.
- Deleted target -> disable source opening.
- Parsed Diff has no Hunks -> keep file-level navigation available.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: an SSH nested-repository target keeps Git paths repository-relative while source reveal receives the project-relative prefixed path.
- Base: a one-file, one-Hunk review disables both navigation boundary buttons.
- Bad: using `status` in target identity remounts the viewer during refresh and loses navigation position.
- Bad: registering `F7` on `window` steals the shortcut from terminals outside the review dialog.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test tracked/untracked order, `M`/`D` filtering, repository identity, refresh reconciliation, Hunk/file transitions, boundaries, and zero-Hunk fallback.
- Unit-test opening a non-first changed file on the first render and reopening a mounted dialog with a different initial file.
- Assert settings default, persisted-value validation, and preference-sync classification.
- Run the shared Viewer architecture test and the SSH Git regression test.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: environment and global state leak into the shared viewer.
window.addEventListener("keydown", handleF7);
invoke("git_get_file_diff", { projectPath, filePath });

// Correct: the host injects transport and source-reveal capabilities.
<GitDiffReviewDialog loadDiff={gitStore.loadFileDiff} onOpenSource={revealSource} />
```

## Diff Generation Options

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Applies to live Git review and pinned-editor Diff loading for local, WSL, macOS/Linux, and SSH repositories.
- Snapshot consumers remain unchanged and do not expose generation controls.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type GitDiffWhitespaceMode = "exact" | "ignore-eol" | "ignore-all";
type GitDiffContextLines = 3 | 10 | 20;

interface GitDiffOptions {
  whitespace: GitDiffWhitespaceMode;
  contextLines: GitDiffContextLines;
}

GitTransport.getFileDiff(
  repoId: string,
  path: string,
  status: string,
  options?: GitDiffOptions,
): Promise<GitTransportResult<GitFileDiffPayload>>;
```

### 3. Contracts

- The default is `exact` plus 3 context lines. Omitting `options` preserves the legacy request and result.
- `settingsStore.gitDiffWhitespaceMode` and `settingsStore.gitDiffContextLines` belong to the `preferences` sync domain; invalid persisted values migrate to the defaults.
- Desktop local uses libgit2 `ignore_whitespace_eol`, `ignore_whitespace`, and `context_lines`. WSL and SSH CLI use `--ignore-space-at-eol`, `--ignore-all-space`, and `--unified=N`.
- A non-`exact` payload always returns `canRevertHunks=false`. The controller must also guard its Hunk and line mutation callbacks; hiding buttons alone is insufficient.
- SSH sends explicit `exact+3` through legacy `gitDiff` without an `options` field. Non-default values use `gitDiffWithOptions` and require `gitDiffOptions` capability.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Missing options | Normalize to `exact+3` |
| Persisted whitespace/context outside the fixed enums | Migrate to `exact+3` |
| Rust request contains unsupported context lines or unknown fields | Reject at the command/Agent boundary |
| Non-exact Diff | Return `canRevertHunks=false`; keep whole-file discard available |
| SSH Agent lacks `gitDiffOptions` | Show localized upgrade guidance; do not write the request frame |
| Non-UTF-8, binary, untracked, or conflict target | Preserve the existing read-only/safe fallback |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: changing from 3 to 20 context lines reloads the same stable target without changing repository identity.
- Base: an old SSH Agent receives only legacy `gitDiff` for `exact+3` and continues working.
- Bad: send `{ options: { whitespace: "exact", contextLines: 3 } }` with legacy `gitDiff`; published Agents reject the unknown field.
- Bad: allow `revertHunk` to execute only because the method is callable after the UI button was hidden.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run real Git fixtures for all whitespace modes and 3/10/20 context lines on Desktop native and POSIX Agent CLI paths.
- Assert invalid context rejection, non-exact `canRevertHunks=false`, settings migration/sync, and controller mutation guards.
- Assert the daemon rejects a missing capability before request serialization and that explicit default SSH options produce a field-compatible legacy payload.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: legacy Agent rejects the unknown options field.
request("gitDiff", { repoPath, relativePath, status, options });

// Correct: preserve the legacy wire shape; negotiate only new behavior.
const legacy = isDefaultGitDiffOptions(options);
request(
  legacy ? "gitDiff" : "gitDiffWithOptions",
  legacy ? { repoPath, relativePath, status } : { repoPath, relativePath, status, options },
);
```

## Pinned Editor Workspace

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Applies when a live Git review target is pinned into the existing `file-editor` surface.
- Snapshot consumers remain read-only and never create pinned tabs.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
acquireGitTransportLease(project: Project): Promise<GitTransportLease>;
createGitDiffTabId(contextKey: string, repositoryId: string, filePath: string): string;
```

### 3. Contracts

- Pinned tabs live in `gitDiffWorkspaceStore`, keyed by project id, environment, host, and normalized project path; repository id plus repository-relative file path identifies one tab.
- The workspace stores serializable identity only. It must not store a `Project`, `GitTransport`, callback, or request promise.
- `FileEditorPane` composes `GitDiffEditorHost`; it must not own Git IPC, Transport creation, Diff loading, or revert mutations.
- The Git panel and pinned host acquire reference-counted leases. A pinned mutation uses its own lease and only calls `gitStore.refreshIfContext(contextKey)` as a context-guarded notification.
- Background pinned refresh updates only the pinned target. It must not duplicate the Git panel polling request.
- Local Windows drive identities are case-insensitive; POSIX and WSL path segments preserve case. Local and WSL environments never share a lease key.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Same project/repository/file is pinned again | Update metadata and activate the existing tab |
| Same file path exists in another nested repository | Open a distinct tab |
| Active change disappears after refresh | Close that pinned tab and select an adjacent tab |
| Project/host/remote path/Agent installation changes | Release the old lease and ignore its late results |
| Pinned Transport acquisition fails | Show a localized error state; never fall back from SSH to local Git |
| Revert confirmation remains open while another tab is selected | Keep the message and mutation bound to the originally requested tab |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: closing the Git panel leaves the pinned SSH Diff operational because the pinned host still owns a lease.
- Base: closing the last consumer releases `history_remote_close`; local and WSL disposal is a no-op.
- Bad: storing the current global `gitStore.transport` in a pinned tab or using it for a write after project switching.
- Bad: lowercasing a POSIX project path and merging `/Work/Repo` with `/work/repo`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test concurrent acquire, idempotent release, final-consumer disposal, and acquire-during-release ordering.
- Unit-test Windows root normalization, POSIX/WSL case sensitivity, project path isolation, root/nested repository identity, and duplicate-tab activation.
- Assert `FileEditorPane` has no Git IPC/mutation ownership and all pinned-editor responsibility modules remain at most 300 lines.
- Run the shared Viewer navigation, settings, architecture, and SSH root-repository regressions.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: a pinned write follows whichever panel context is current now.
await useGitStore.getState().discardFile(tab.filePath, tab.status);

// Correct: the pinned host writes through its own leased capability.
await lease.transport.discardFile(tab.repositoryId, tab.filePath, tab.status);
await useGitStore.getState().refreshIfContext(lease.contextKey);
```

## Interaction And Accessibility

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Applies to selectable insert/delete gutters in the shared live Diff viewer and to the modal Dialog host.
- Snapshot Diff remains read-only; pinned Diff uses the same selection semantics without adding a second Dialog.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
interface GitDiffSelectionState {
  selectedKeys: ReadonlySet<string>;
  anchors: Partial<Record<"old" | "new" | "unified", GitDiffSelectionAnchor>>;
}

applyGitDiffSelection(state, { target, order, scope, extend }): GitDiffSelectionState;
findAdjacentGitDiffChange(order, currentKey, side, direction): GitDiffSelectableChange | null;
```

### 3. Contracts

- Selection order comes from parsed Hunk changes, never DOM row numbers. Normal lines are absent from the selectable order.
- Split mode owns independent old/new anchors. Unified mode owns one anchor and resets to the current line when Shift selection crosses sides.
- Click and Enter/Space toggle one insert/delete. Shift+click and Shift+Arrow extend across the same side's visible change order.
- A Diff content, target, generation-option, or view-mode identity change clears selection and anchors.
- `canRevertLines` gates pointer handlers, keyboard handlers, focusable gutters, and Controller mutation execution.
- Selected state uses background, inset border, a visible check mark, `aria-pressed`, and a polite live count. Insert/delete keep visible `+`/`-` markers.
- Modal hosts use the shared Radix Dialog primitive for modal semantics, focus trapping, top-layer Escape, and focus restoration. IME-composing Escape is ignored.
- Dialog accessible names contain the active file name. Opening focuses the first enabled toolbar/header command.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Normal line gutter | Not focusable or selectable |
| Shift range contains normal/opposite-side lines | Select only same-side insert/delete entries |
| Split side has no anchor | Select current line and establish only that side's anchor |
| Unified Shift target changes side | Clear the previous range and select the target only |
| Non-UTF-8, non-exact, untracked, or backend-disabled payload | No interactive gutter; partial mutation remains guarded |
| Escape while IME is composing | Keep the Dialog open |
| Nested confirmation Dialog is open | Only Radix's top dismissable layer handles Escape; file and Hunk destructive actions confirm before mutation |

### Common Mistake: Mounting a nested confirmation below the Diff Dialog

**Symptom**: Clicking file-level or Hunk revert from the Git Diff Dialog appears to freeze the UI; the confirmation prompt is hidden and the Diff Dialog cannot be interacted with.

**Cause**: `GitDiffDialogFrame` renders its overlay/content at `z-index` 100/101, while a confirmation dialog mounted by the parent Git panel uses the shared `ConfirmDialog` default of 50. Two Radix modal focus scopes remain active, but the lower confirmation layer cannot receive visible interaction.

**Fix**: Set the higher layer only at each Git Diff confirmation call site. The shared `ConfirmDialog` accepts `zIndex` and applies it to both overlay and content; use a value above the Diff Dialog layer (currently 220). Do not change the shared default because unrelated consumers would inherit the behavior change. The Hunk button must open this confirmation first and invoke `controller.revertHunk` only after confirmation.

```tsx
<ConfirmDialog
  open={discardTarget !== null}
  zIndex={220}
  onConfirm={confirmDiscard}
  onClose={closeConfirm}
/>
```

### 5. Tests Required

- Unit-test toggle, split anchors, unified cross-side reset, same-side range filtering, and keyboard adjacency.
- Assert the Dialog has Radix autofocus/restore hooks and no `window` key listener.
- Assert file-level revert confirmation is above `GitDiffDialogFrame` and that confirm/cancel/Escape returns interaction to the underlying Diff Dialog.
- Assert Hunk revert opens a second confirmation, does not mutate before confirmation, and uses the same top-layer behavior.
- Assert focusable gutters expose marker, check, and pressed semantics; selection count uses `aria-live`.
- Run shared Viewer architecture, navigation, generation-option, settings, and pinned-editor regressions.

## Large Diff Performance And Limits

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Applies to shared text Diff rendering for snapshot and live sources on Windows, Linux, macOS, WSL, and SSH.
- It changes parsing and rendering policy only. Binary, image, office, archive, audio, and video Diff support must not be added here; the supported file types and existing read-only fallbacks remain unchanged.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
interface GitFileDiffPayload {
  content: string;
  canRevertHunks: boolean;
  byteLength: number;
  lineCount: number;
}

normalizeGitDiffPayload(payload: {
  content: string;
  canRevertHunks: boolean;
  byteLength?: number;
  lineCount?: number;
}): GitFileDiffPayload;
```

### 3. Contracts

- Diff content at or below 64 KiB parses synchronously; larger accepted content parses in `gitDiffParser.worker.ts`.
- Each Worker request carries a generation. Cleanup invalidates the generation and terminates the Worker; success or fallback also terminates it immediately and settles only once.
- Worker failure falls back to main-thread parsing with syntax highlighting disabled. Only parsing failure enters the existing read-only Monaco raw-patch fallback.
- Syntax highlighting is enabled only at or below both 256 KiB and 5000 lines. Mounted Hunk blocks tokenize independently; unmounted Hunks create neither tokens nor row DOM.
- `GitDiffHunkList` virtualizes by Hunk with dynamic measurement. Keyboard navigation may scroll an unmounted target Hunk first, but it must restore focus only if the pending file identity still matches.
- Local and SSH transports normalize payload metadata at their boundary. Missing metadata from an older Agent is derived with UTF-8 byte length and Rust `str::lines()` semantics.
- Content above 768 KiB or 20000 lines is rejected with `git_diff_too_large`; it is never truncated and never exposes Hunk/line revert actions.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `byteLength <= 64 KiB` | Parse synchronously |
| `byteLength > 64 KiB` within hard limits | Parse in Worker; toolbar and close remain responsive |
| `byteLength > 256 KiB` or `lineCount > 5000` | Render insert/delete/Hunk styles without syntax tokens |
| Worker construction, execution, or response failure | Terminate once; parse on main thread without highlighting |
| Target/content changes while Worker or virtual focus is pending | Ignore old result and old focus request |
| `byteLength > 768 KiB` or `lineCount > 20000` | Localized `git.diff.tooLarge`; no partial-revert entry |
| Parser rejects otherwise accepted text | Read-only Monaco raw-patch fallback |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: an accepted 300 KiB SSH Diff parses in a Worker and renders virtualized plain Hunks without syntax highlighting.
- Base: a 20 KiB snapshot parses synchronously and keeps the existing read-only behavior.
- Good: Agent `0.1.4` omits metadata; the transport derives it before the shared Viewer receives the payload.
- Bad: tokenize all Hunks before virtualization, keep a completed Worker alive, or let an old Worker overwrite a newly selected file.
- Bad: truncate an oversized patch and leave revert controls enabled; a truncated patch is not a valid mutation source.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert inclusive boundaries for 64 KiB, 256 KiB, 5000 lines, 768 KiB, and 20000 lines.
- Assert UTF-8 byte and Rust line-count compatibility for legacy payloads, including legacy payloads above both hard limits.
- Assert generation invalidation, settle-time Worker termination, fallback highlight disablement, Hunk virtualization, dynamic measurement, and cross-Hunk keyboard focus.
- Run shared architecture, navigation, generation-option, accessibility, local Transport, SSH Transport, Desktop Rust, and Agent Rust regressions plus the production frontend build.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: parse and tokenize the entire accepted patch during render.
const file = parseDiff(content)[0];
const tokens = tokenize(file.hunks, { highlight: true, refractor, language });

// Correct: parse large content off-thread and tokenize only mounted Hunks under the threshold.
const parsed = useGitDiffParser(content, byteLength);
const syntaxHighlight = !parsed.workerFallback && shouldHighlightGitDiff(metadata);
```

## Theme, Wrapping, And Open Host Preferences

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Live Git review dialogs and pinned editor Diff use the active terminal theme even when the application and terminal tones differ.
- Snapshot consumers keep their existing application-theme behavior unless they explicitly request terminal theming.

### 2. Signatures

```ts
type GitDiffOpenMode = "dialog" | "editor";

interface GitDiffViewerProps {
  useTerminalTheme?: boolean;
  wrapLines?: boolean;
  onWrapLinesChange?: (wrapLines: boolean) => void;
}

useGitDiffOpenWorkflow(options): {
  openPreferredDiff(filePath: string): boolean;
  openSourcePath(sourcePath: string, status: string, lineNumber?: number): Promise<boolean>;
  pinDiff(target: GitDiffReviewTarget): Promise<boolean>;
  sourcePathForFile(filePath: string): string;
};
```

### 3. Contracts

- `settingsStore.gitDiffOpenMode` defaults to `dialog`; `gitDiffWrapLines` defaults to `true`. Both validate persisted input and belong to the `preferences` sync domain.
- Application Diff tokens are scoped to `data-git-diff-theme="application"`. Terminal roots provide complete surface, text, semantic, interaction, selection, and syntax tokens; global application light selectors must not override them.
- Refractor token class names are runtime syntax metadata, not Tailwind utility intent. Inside `.diff-code`, token spans must retain inline source-fragment layout even when a language grammar emits a class such as `table` that collides with a global utility.
- Wrapped mode uses fixed-layout tables and `pre-wrap`. Unwrapped Split mode uses fixed gutter tracks plus equal `minmax(0, 1fr)` code tracks, while code cells use `white-space: pre` and one `GitDiffContent` horizontal scrollbar writes the same `scrollLeft` to both sides.
- The Split center remains fixed during horizontal scrolling. Newly virtualized Hunk cells receive the current offset, and container or line-width changes recalculate the shared scroll range.
- Hunk containers have no decorative border, radius, shadow, or overflow clipping. Changing wrap or view mode remeasures virtual Hunk heights.
- Pinning from the review dialog persists `editor` only after the tab opens successfully. The pinned Pin control toggles the future default back to `dialog` without closing the current tab.
- Source reveal and Pin close the review dialog only after success. Failures keep it open and use the existing localized toast.
- Open-host preference changes only UI routing. Repository identity, Transport leases, mutation capabilities, file support, and snapshot read-only behavior remain unchanged.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Missing or invalid `gitDiffOpenMode` | Migrate to `dialog` |
| Missing or non-boolean `gitDiffWrapLines` | Migrate to `true` |
| Application and terminal tones differ | Resolve all live Diff tokens from the terminal palette |
| `wrapLines=false` with an overlong line | Preserve one line, keep Split columns equal, and expose the content-owned synchronized scrollbar |
| Pin cannot open the target tab | Keep `gitDiffOpenMode` unchanged, keep the dialog open, and show the localized error toast |
| Source reveal returns `false` or throws | Keep the dialog open and show the localized error toast |
| Preferred editor mode cannot resolve the selected change | Return `false` so the caller can retain the dialog fallback |
| Deleted target requests source reveal | Return `false`; source action remains disabled |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: the application is light and the terminal is dark; the dialog surface, controls, syntax colors, focus rings, and native control scheme all remain dark-terminal themed.
- Good: after a successful Pin, selecting another changed file reuses the pinned-editor workspace; toggling Pin there restores future dialog routing without closing the active tab.
- Base: existing persisted settings omit both new keys and retain the legacy dialog plus wrapped-line behavior.
- Bad: persist `editor` before tab creation finishes; a failed Pin would silently change future routing.
- Bad: make the Diff table `max-content`; intrinsic line width moves the Split center and gives each side a different effective viewport.
- Bad: give each Hunk or side its own visible scrollbar; virtualized Hunks drift to different horizontal offsets.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert settings defaults, validation, and sync classification.
- Assert terminal/application selector isolation, toolbar interaction states, fixed nowrap Split tracks, synchronized virtual-cell offsets, Hunk remeasurement, and absence of the old framed container classes.
- Assert Markdown table header, separator, and body token spans remain inline in wrapped and unwrapped Diff code cells; do not replace the source-code Diff with rendered Markdown HTML.
- Assert pin/open routing and success-gated dialog close behavior.
- Run the architecture limit test and assert each Diff responsibility module remains at most 300 lines with no environment-specific branching in the shared viewer.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: change the preference before the asynchronous host operation succeeds.
await updateSetting("gitDiffOpenMode", "editor");
await openPinnedDiff(target);

// Correct: success gates both persistence and dialog closure.
const opened = await openPinnedTarget(target, true);
if (opened) onClose();
```

```css
/* Wrong: the application theme overrides terminal-themed descendants. */
[data-theme="light"] .diff-viewer-container { --diff-bg: #ffffff; }

/* Correct: application tokens apply only to application-themed roots. */
[data-git-diff-theme="application"][data-theme-mode="light"] .diff-viewer-container {
  --diff-bg: #ffffff;
}
```
